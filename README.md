# Java-Capstone-Project
Capstone project for Java specialization on Coursera.org.

These files implement my final project for the 5-course specialization:
"Java Programming: Object Oriented Design of Data Structures" 
offered by UC San Diego at Coursera.org, as well as some code for
smaller assignments.

Graph.java began as a stub file provided by the instructors.

This project examines a graph of Facebook connections to determine
the edge most critical to connections among members using the
Floyd-Warshall algorithm.
